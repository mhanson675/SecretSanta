# SecretSanta
 Web app for picking secret santa assignments.
 
 A list of participants is created containing names, emails, and mailing addresses.
 
 Once the list is completed the user can ask the app to pull the names which will pair each participant with another participant (it is not possible to get paired with oneself).
 
 Then uses a preconfigured gmail account to send a message to each participant containing who they picked and that individuals mailing address.
